# CD-Raft
We have implemented a CD-Raft-based prototype system. CD-Raft innovatively adopts the Fast Return strategy and the Optimal Master Leader Election strategy to optimize communication latency in cross-domain scenarios, significantly improving system performance while ensuring cross-domain disaster tolerance capabilities and strong consistency guarantees.
